# SoundStorm — working notes for Claude

Read this first. It carries decisions that the code cannot tell you, including
two reversals of earlier decisions that looked right and were not.

## What this is

A unified front end for a self-hosted media library. One login, one search box,
one player over Navidrome (music), Jellyfin (films and TV), Audiobookshelf
(audiobooks) and a plain folder of EPUBs (ebooks).

The user's words for what they wanted: *"an all-encompassing server that can do
movies, audiobooks, ebooks, music all together... easy for users to install and
then create a login... and put their library into organized folders."*

## The decision that shapes everything

That request sounds like "build a media server". It is not, and the difference
is the whole project.

**Rejected: fork Jellyfin, or build a media server from scratch.** Either means
owning the expensive part — scanning disks, identifying media, storing metadata
and artwork, transcoding. That is years of work to arrive somewhere worse than
what exists. Forking additionally buys a permanent merge tax against a large
C# codebase, in exchange for the ability to change internals that none of the
requirements touch.

**Chosen: own the layer above.** Each backend owns exactly one media type and
one folder. Nothing scans the same folder twice. SoundStorm owns login, search,
playback and the bytes. From the user's seat this is indistinguishable from a
single server — they never learn Jellyfin exists — but Jellyfin still does the
transcoding and Navidrome still does the music scanning.

Navidrome rather than Jellyfin for music specifically: multi-value artist tags,
album-artist vs artist, compilations, ReplayGain, smart playlists, fast scanner.
Jellyfin's music support is a second-class citizen next to its video support,
structurally. Getting Navidrome's music engine *for free* is exactly what the
fork would have made you rebuild by hand.

**If the seams leak, the whole thing is pointless.** Guard this. A result that
links out to a backend's web UI means a second login and a visibly different
app, and at that point you have built a bookmark folder.

## Two reversals from the first design

The original code was an API-only federating gateway. Its instincts were good
and two of them were wrong for this product:

1. **"Never proxy media bytes; results carry absolute upstream URLs."** An
   upstream URL only works if the browser can reach the upstream, which means
   publishing Jellyfin and Navidrome on their own ports, which means their login
   screens are one URL away. You cannot have "one login" and "never touch the
   bytes" at once. SoundStorm is now in the data path. See `internal/stream`.
2. **"Stateless, restartable, no config writes."** Zero-keys provisioning means
   SoundStorm generates credentials, so it must remember them. One login means a
   user and sessions. Both outlive a restart. See `internal/state` — note that
   it holds *only* credentials and the account, never anything about the media.

## What SoundStorm deliberately does not do

Each of these has killed a project like this before.

- **Transcoding.** Jellyfin owns this.
- **Metadata scraping.** Each backend already owns its metadata.
- **Library scanning.** Same.
- **Client apps for TVs.** The graveyard.
- **Rebuilding an app store.** Installation is solved and crowded.

## Three rules the design rests on

1. **A dead backend must never take the search down.** Per-source deadline,
   per-source error slot, always 200, `degraded` says what is missing. Tests in
   `internal/federate` and `internal/httpapi` protect this.
2. **Normalization happens at the edge.** Only an adapter knows its backend's
   vocabulary. Everything past it speaks `media.Item`.
3. **A backend is two halves: search and provisioning.** A backend a human must
   configure by hand defeats the point. Both halves or it is not done.

## Why Jellyfin, specifically

Asked and answered rather than assumed. Plex requires a plex.tv account, so it
cannot be provisioned without a human logging into a cloud service - which is
fatal to the zero-keys claim, not merely inconvenient. Emby went closed-source.
Everything else in that space is too thin to bet a stack on.

The rule in the next section predicts it independently: video is not
self-describing and does need transcoding, so it stays delegated. That is the
same rule that said drop Calibre-Web, so it is cutting both ways.

The honest cost is API churn (Jellyfin 12 broke two documented auth methods
under us) and a 2.5GB image next to Navidrome's 348MB. That trade only clearly
pays off once SoundStorm uses Jellyfin's transcoding, which it still does not.

## One backend, two sources

Films and series are separate Jellyfin libraries - different collection types,
different scrapers, seasons and episodes only for the latter - so Jellyfin is
provisioned once and registered as two sources sharing one token: `jellyfin`
(Movie) and `jellyfin-tv` (Series,Episode).

`source.Source` always said "a server that serves two kinds is configured as two
sources", and that was not actually possible until `jellyfin.Config` grew a
Kind and ItemTypes; the adapter hardcoded `KindVideo`. `provision.buildSources`
now returns a slice for this reason.

## Dropping files in

Dragging onto the window does what dragging into the folder would have done,
including working out which folder that was. `internal/library/intake.go` owns
the decision; `internal/httpapi` owns the two endpoints.

**Two steps, not one multipart request.** `POST /api/upload/plan` takes a list
of paths and answers where each would go; `PUT /api/upload?path=&kind=` takes
one file as the whole request body. The split buys three things a streamed
multipart upload cannot have: the UI can say "14 files, 2 skipped, all going to
Films" before a gigabyte moves, the grouping can see the whole list, and the
body being nothing but the file means no parser between the socket and the disk.

**Placement is per dropped item, not per file.** A film folder holds an .mkv, a
.srt and a poster; the subtitle is useless in the ebook shelf and invisible
anywhere but beside its film. So the first file in a group that can name a shelf
decides for all of them, and companions - subtitles, artwork, .nfo, .opf - get
no vote and inherit the answer. A folder of nothing but companions names no
shelf and is skipped, which is right: a lone .srt has no home.

**When it cannot tell, it asks.** One drop zone, no shelf targets: guessing
wrong costs somebody moving files on disk, so the bar for guessing is "there is
real evidence", not "one of them is more likely". A question is asked per
*group*, so a thirty-chapter audiobook is one decision, and the answer goes back
to `/api/upload/plan` which re-plans - the destination shown is always the one
the server will use rather than something worked out twice.

The list of things worth asking about is deliberately short, because a question
on every album drop would be worse than the occasional wrong guess:

- **mp3, and only mp3.** flac, wav, aiff and alac are music in practice; m4a is
  music because audiobooks in that family use m4b. Mp3 really is both - every
  LibriVox recording is one.
- **Three or more videos in one folder with no episode numbering.** One or two
  unnumbered .mkv files is a film and its extras; six is a series somebody named
  badly, and six episodes in the film library is worth a question.

Everything else stays decisive: `.epub` is a book, `.m4b` is an audiobook, a
path mentioning audiobooks is believed, and `S01E01`, `1x02` or a `Season 01`
folder is television. A question only offers libraries the account actually
has, and with one option left it stops being a question.

**Nothing appears at its destination until all of it is there.** Navidrome and
Audiobookshelf watch these folders and a half-written file is exactly what a
scanner indexes as a corrupt track. Bytes land in `<library>/.uploads` and are
renamed into place, which is atomic because it is the same filesystem, and
invisible to the backends because a top-level dot-directory is not mounted into
any of them. `ClearStaging` sweeps it at boot for the crash case.

**Every path is attacker-supplied.** One trap here cost a real bug, caught by
its own test: `TrimRight(segment, ". ")` ran *before* the `..` check, so ".."
became "" and was skipped - which quietly turned `../../etc/passwd.mp3` into
`etc/passwd.mp3` and wrote it. No escape, but a strange file in somebody's music
folder and no sign a path had been rewritten. Dot runs are now refused before
anything is trimmed. `Save` also re-checks the joined path is still inside the
folder, which is a thing worth doing twice.

Uploading follows the same permission as reading: you can add to a shelf you can
see. A restriction search honours and uploading does not is not a restriction,
so the plan refuses forbidden kinds and so does the upload.

On the browser side, `walkEntry` must call `readEntries` **until it returns an
empty batch**. It hands back at most a hundred at a time, and reading once
silently truncates a large folder - the classic way to lose half an album. There
is a test for it that builds a fake entry tree, because a synthetic DataTransfer
gets no filesystem entries and no automated drag can produce real ones.

## Accounts, and the one thing that is per person

Two roles, and the gap between them is deliberately thin: the **owner** is
whoever installed the server and can add and remove people; everyone else is a
**member**. That is the entire difference. A media server for a household does
not need a permission matrix, and every role beyond these two is a decision
somebody has to make about their family.

Signup is a first-boot action and closes the moment an account exists - a
second one would be a stranger who found the port claiming somebody else's
server. After that only the owner adds accounts. There are no invite links and
no open registration, because this thing is meant to be reachable from outside
a house.

**Which shelves somebody can see is per account.** `User.Libraries` is a list
of media kinds, and nil means all of them - which is what every account created
before the field existed has, and the default for a new one. The owner is always
unrestricted whatever is stored: they are the only account that can change
these, so an owner who locked themselves out would have no way back in.

The enforcement is the reason `Registry.All`, `Matching` and `ByID` take a
context. The context carries `source.Access`, the middleware sets it once for
every guarded route, and a handler physically cannot reach a source without
passing the request's context - which is what applies the restriction. Changing
those three signatures made the compiler find all ten call sites; remembering to
check in each handler would not have.

`AccessFrom` defaults to unrestricted, because provisioning, health checks and
the library counter have no account and must see everything. That is a fail-open
default, so `internal/httpapi/libraries_test.go` walks every endpoint that can
hand over bytes, metadata or a playable URL and asserts a restricted account is
refused - including `/api/stream`, because hiding search results is not a
permission when the URL is guessable from an ordinary result.

The granularity is **a whole media kind**, which is the same thing as a source,
because a source serves exactly one kind. "No films for the seven-year-old" is
answerable; "only these films" is not, and would mean per-user Jellyfin accounts
and its parental ratings. Do not creep toward that without deciding it is worth
a second provisioning path.

**Beyond that, almost nothing differs per person.** Search returns the same
results and a film is the same bytes whoever asked. Exactly two other things are
personal:

- **Reading position**, which is ours, and is keyed `userID/sourceID/itemID`.
- **Listening position**, which is Audiobookshelf's, and is keyed by *its*
  account - so two people sharing one account there overwrite each other.

That second one is why `internal/state` grew `Identity` and why
`provision.TokenFor` exists. A member gets their own Audiobookshelf account,
created lazily on first use rather than when they are added: a backend can be
down or still provisioning when somebody joins, and first use is a retry that
costs nothing to write. The owner is special-cased to the shared administrator
credential - they provisioned the backend and already have an account on it, so
giving them a second one would split their own history in two.

Navidrome and Jellyfin keep one shared account on purpose. Nothing SoundStorm
surfaces from them differs per person, so an account each would be four times
the provisioning for no visible gain. Revisit when watched-state or favourites
reach the UI.

`source.WithUserID` carries the account id to the adapters, and it lives in
`internal/source` rather than `internal/auth` so an adapter can find out who is
asking without depending on how signing in works.

Two things verified against Audiobookshelf 2.36.1 rather than read anywhere:

- **`isActive` must be sent when creating a user.** Without it the account is
  created inactive, `POST /api/users` returns an ordinary 200 with a token in
  it, and that token answers `Unauthorized` to everything. Nothing in the
  response suggests a problem.
- **The create response carries a token**, so there is no second login call and
  no reason to keep the password. Deleting the user invalidates it at once.

Removing somebody deletes their sessions, their bookmarks and their backend
accounts. The backend accounts go **first**, because deleting the SoundStorm
account drops the record of which Audiobookshelf user belonged to it and after
that nothing knows what to clean up. It is best effort: a backend that is down
must not stop somebody being removed.

## TLS without anybody running openssl

`internal/servetls`. A home server has no domain name and no route an ACME
challenge can reach, so the certificate is made locally - but as a local
*authority* rather than a bare self-signed certificate. Install `/ca.crt` once
per device and everything SoundStorm issues afterwards is trusted, including
certificates for addresses it had never seen. A self-signed leaf would have to
be re-trusted on every renewal and every new address.

**Certificates are minted from the handshake, not from configuration.**
SoundStorm is in a container, so the addresses on its own interfaces are the
container's - 172.18.0.5, never the 192.168.1.50 somebody types - and it cannot
learn the real one. The handshake carries it: SNI for a hostname, and for a
bare IP, which browsers send no SNI for, `ClientHelloInfo.Conn.LocalAddr()` is
by definition the address the client dialled. `SOUNDSTORM_TLS_HOSTS` is
therefore optional and only saves the first request a signature.

One name per certificate. The first version pre-minted a single leaf covering
every local address, and its SANs then enumerated the machine's Tailscale
address, eight IPv6 prefixes and its Windows hostname to anybody who opened a
connection.

Off by default: on localhost there is nothing on the wire to protect and a
certificate warning is a poor first screen. An unknown `SOUNDSTORM_TLS` value
is **fatal** - quietly serving plain HTTP to somebody who asked for encryption
is the worst available way to be wrong.

`SOUNDSTORM_TRUST_PROXY` lets `X-Forwarded-Proto` decide whether the session
cookie is Secure, for a reverse proxy that terminates TLS. Off unless asked
for, because any client can send that header.

## The folders are the interface

Installing SoundStorm creates `library/` with four subfolders, and the app's first
screen is a guide to them rather than an empty search grid. This is deliberate
product surface, not convenience: the folders are the only part of SoundStorm a user
interacts with that has no UI, so they are created for you, named for what
people call the thing ("movies", not "video"), and described in the app. A
README nobody reads is not an interface.

`internal/library` owns this. It reads the directory for exactly two reasons -
creating it, and counting files so the UI can distinguish "you have not added
anything" from "a scan is still running". It does not index. Do not let it grow
into an indexer.

One asymmetry worth knowing: only `localbooks` reports an indexed count, so the
music, movie and audiobook rows show files-on-disk with no comparison. Navidrome
and Jellyfin would each need a count call to fix that.

## PDFs, and why there is no PDF parser

`internal/pdf` does not parse PDF structure, deliberately. Doing it properly
means the cross-reference table, then cross-reference streams, then object
streams - hundreds of lines before the first title appears. Measured against
five real PDFs from five producers (pdfTeX, Gutenberg, Adobe Designer,
Ghostscript, PDFsam), all that machinery would have returned nothing: every one
had an Info dictionary that was absent or literally empty, `/Title ()`.

Two of the five carried an XMP packet - Dublin Core, plain XML, uncompressed -
which a byte scan and `encoding/xml` reach for free, in the same vocabulary
`internal/epub` already speaks. So the order is XMP, then the Info dictionary if
it happens to be readable, then the filename.

For PDFs the filename is a primary source, not a fallback. Most were never told
anything about themselves and whoever saved the file put the only real
information into its name.

One trap worth knowing: XMP nests every value inside `rdf:Alt` or `rdf:Seq`
containing `rdf:li`, so reading `dc:title` as a plain string yields an empty
one. That is exactly how those five files first looked like they had no
metadata at all.

No covers: extracting one means rendering page one, which needs a PDF renderer
this project is not carrying. No reading position either - PDFs go to the
browser's own viewer in an iframe, and browser viewers do not expose position.

## The one media type SoundStorm owns, and why that is not a slippery slope

Ebooks have no backend. Calibre-Web was removed: it needed a *database* rather
than a folder, its setup had no API (CSRF form-scraping), and its password could
not be rotated. SoundStorm reads the folder itself.

The justification is narrow and should stay narrow: **an EPUB is
self-describing.** The file contains its own title, author, language and cover
in a documented XML format, and a book needs no transcoding. `Dune.2021.mkv`
contains none of that, which is precisely the work Jellyfin exists to do.

So the line is: SoundStorm can own a media type when it is self-describing and needs
no transcoding. EPUB qualifies. Video never will. Do not cite `internal/epub` as
precedent for scanning anything else.

Existing Calibre libraries still work, with no SQLite driver: Calibre writes a
`metadata.opf` sidecar beside every book in exactly the format an EPUB carries
internally, so one parser reads both.

## The reader

Rendering is foliate-js (MIT), vendored under `internal/webui/assets/vendor/`.
Writing it ourselves was considered and rejected for the same reason as
transcoding: `paginator.js` is 44KB and `epubcfi.js` is 13KB, and those are the
two genuinely hard parts. Reflowable text means a page number is meaningless -
change the font size and "page 47" is different words - so position has to be a
content-anchored locator (an EPUB CFI).

This is the only third-party code in the project. It does not break the
zero-dependency rule's intent: the files are checked in, pinned by content,
embedded via go:embed, and fetched at no point during a build. The Go module
still has no dependencies and no go.sum.

What is ours: SoundStorm unzips server-side (`/api/book/resource`), so no zip
library runs in the browser, and it remembers reading position across devices.

## Verified against live servers

These were checked on a running stack, not inferred. Re-verify if versions move.

- **Jellyfin 12.1.0 rejects `X-Emby-Token` and `?api_key=` with 401.** The only
  form it accepts is `Authorization: MediaBrowser ... Token="..."`. Most docs
  and every older client still show the other two. This is why
  `source.Target` carries headers rather than just a URL.
- **Audiobookshelf 2.36.1 `/login` returns two tokens.** `user.accessToken`
  carries an `exp` one hour out; `user.token` is a legacy JWT with no `exp` at
  all. SoundStorm stores the legacy one on purpose - the other would strand the
  backend an hour after provisioning without a refresh flow. If a release drops
  it, that is where the refresh dance goes.
- **Audiobookshelf addresses audio by inode, not item id.** `/api/items/{id}`
  has to be fetched to learn it, which is why `source.Streamer` takes a context.
- **foliate-js `view.open(book)` renders nothing on its own.** You must call
  `view.init({ lastLocation })` afterwards; that is what paints the first page
  or resumes. Miss it and you get a blank reader with no error anywhere.
- **foliate-view's shadow root is `mode: 'closed'`.** A browser test cannot
  reach inside it - observe rendering through the `relocate` event instead.
- **foliate-js probes for optional files** (`META-INF/encryption.xml`, Apple and
  Kobo display options). 404 is the correct answer; those requests log at debug.
- **Calibre-Web was removed** (see above). `internal/source/opds` and
  `internal/provision/calibreweb.go` remain as an opt-in for a Calibre server
  running elsewhere, via `SOUNDSTORM_CALIBREWEB_URL`.
- **Jellyfin's startup wizard is a plain REST API** (`/Startup/Configuration`,
  `/Startup/User`, `/Startup/RemoteAccess`, `/Startup/Complete`) and stops
  accepting calls once setup completes, which makes driving it safe.
- **Navidrome's first-run admin form POSTs to `/auth/createAdmin`** and that
  endpoint only works while no user exists. Same safety property.
- All four need anywhere from seconds to a minute after container start, so
  provisioning retries with backoff in the background while SoundStorm serves.

## Naming

The product is **SoundStorm**; every identifier is **soundstorm**. Module path,
binary, container names, the `SOUNDSTORM_` env prefix, the session cookie, the
account created on each backend, the client identity sent to Jellyfin and
Subsonic - all lowercase. Prose, the page title, the wordmark and anything a
person reads use the brand casing. `TestUIShellIsServed` asserts the shell
carries the display form, which is the one place the distinction is checked.

It was called atrium until the rename. Nothing in the repo should say so.

## How it gets installed

The install is `docker-compose.yml` plus an installer script, and the split
between them is the point: the compose file names a **published image** and
contains no `build:` key, so it works alone in an empty folder for somebody who
never cloned anything. `docker-compose.dev.yml` adds `build: .` back for us.
A `build:` key in the main file would make it refer to a Dockerfile the user
does not have.

`.github/workflows/publish.yml` is what makes that true - without a published
image the install instructions point at nothing. It gates publishing on
gofmt/vet/test, and builds linux/amd64 and linux/arm64, because a lot of home
media servers are a Pi, a Synology or an Apple silicon Mac. The Dockerfile
pins its *builder* to `$BUILDPLATFORM` and cross-compiles via
`GOOS`/`GOARCH`, so the arm64 image does not run the Go toolchain under QEMU.

`install.ps1` is aimed at somebody who has never opened a terminal, because
that is who a self-hosted media server usually gets given to. It installs
Docker Desktop itself with `winget` rather than sending them to a website,
starts Docker rather than telling them to, and leaves desktop, Start Menu and
startup shortcuts rather than an address to remember. `SoundStorm-Setup.cmd`
exists only so the thing can be double-clicked out of the Downloads folder;
asking somebody to open PowerShell and paste a command is the step that loses
people.

Three bugs in that script were found only by running it, and all three are
PowerShell-specific traps worth knowing:

- **A line break before an operator inside `if (...)` is a syntax error** in
  5.1. The file had one for two commits and would not parse at all. It went
  unnoticed because the syntax check discarded the error collection -
  `PSParser::Tokenize` returns tokens and reports errors through a `[ref]`
  parameter, so ignoring it means every file "parses clean".
- **PowerShell strips the inner double quotes** out of
  `--format '{{index .Config.Labels "com.docker..."}}'` on the way to a native
  program, and docker then fails with `function "com" not defined`. Read the
  labels with `ConvertFrom-Json` instead.
- **`Start-Process -PassThru` hands back a Process with no cached handle**, and
  without one `WaitForExit(timeout)` never observes the exit: it returns false
  at the deadline for a program that finished in a second. Reading `.Handle`
  once is what caches it. The symptom is every launch taking exactly the
  timeout and then reporting failure while the containers run perfectly well
  behind it.
- **Native stderr becomes an ErrorRecord**, so with
  `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` a `docker compose up` fails the script by
  printing its ordinary progress. Everything that shells out goes through
  `Invoke-Docker`, which pins the preference to Continue and pipes stderr
  through `Write-Host` so it prints as text rather than as a red block that
  looks like a crash.

The desktop shortcut runs the launcher **minimised**, which is right for the
common case - clicking it when the stack is already up takes half a second -
and wrong for every failure, because console text written into a minimised
window is text nobody will ever see. So `-Launch` failures also open a dialog,
and `compose up -d` gets a deadline: without one, an unreachable registry makes
the icon do nothing at all, for minutes, with no way to tell that from a broken
shortcut. The dialog dismisses itself after two minutes, because at startup
there may be nobody there to click it.

Measured on the development machine: 2.9 seconds from every container stopped,
0.4 seconds when it is already running.

`install.sh` is `/bin/sh`, not bash - a stock Debian's `/bin/sh` is dash, and
that is exactly the cheap box this is aimed at. Every failure message says what
to do next; "Docker is installed but not running" is the most common one by a
distance and is worth its own branch.

Two things learned by testing the installer rather than reasoning about it:

- **The compose project name is fixed (`name: soundstorm`), so a second install
  in a second folder adopts the first one's containers** rather than getting its
  own. It then points at an empty library folder and looks broken. Both
  installers check `com.docker.compose.project.working_dir` on the running
  container and refuse, naming the other folder. Keeping one install per machine
  is right; silently hijacking is not.
- **The POSIX port pre-check cannot always answer.** It asks `nc`, then `ss`,
  then `lsof`, and a machine with none of them - Git Bash on Windows, for one -
  falls through to "assume free". So the real backstop is parsing `compose up`'s
  output for "already allocated" and saying which port and how to change it.

Nothing here is a substitute for the two gaps that actually stop this being a
product for other people: it is **single-user and has no HTTPS**. The README
says so plainly next to the install instructions rather than burying it.

## The starter library

A fresh install arrives with ~22MB of classics already in the library folders,
embedded in the binary and unpacked on first run into folders that are empty.

Bundled rather than downloaded, deliberately. Fetching on install means every
installation spends somebody else's bandwidth, and Project Gutenberg states
outright that automated access to its website earns an IP block. It also means
the first run works air-gapped. The cost is binary size, and that is why there
is no video: one film outweighs everything else combined, so the UI names
Blender's open movies instead of shipping one.

Two Windows-specific traps live in here, both of which cost real time:

- `go:embed` rejects file names containing an apostrophe. The bundled files do
  without; what a reader sees comes from metadata, not the file name.
- `os.MkdirAll` is documented to succeed for an existing directory, and does on
  a normal filesystem. On a Docker Desktop bind mount it can return EEXIST
  instead - which made the starter library skip exactly the folders compose
  mounts into backends (music, audiobooks) while succeeding for ebooks, which
  nothing mounts. `ensureDir` treats an existing directory as success.

Do not move `library/` while the stack is running. The backends hold bind mounts
into its subfolders, and replacing the directory leaves them dangling in a state
where stat and mkdir disagree about whether a path exists.

## Testing against real media

`scripts/fetch-test-library.ps1` builds a library from Project Gutenberg,
LibriVox, the Internet Archive etree collection and the Blender open movies -
all public domain or CC, all resumable, about 750MB by default.

It exists because synthetic files cannot find a whole class of bug: every one of
them has exactly the metadata we chose to write. The first run against real
files found three, none of which thirteen generated files could have surfaced.
Run it before believing anything about how this behaves in the wild.

**These are donated services. Do not hammer them.** Project Gutenberg states
plainly that its website "is intended for human users only" and that automated
access "will result in a temporary or permanent block of your IP address"; the
sanctioned routes are the mirrors and /robot/harvest, throttled. The script uses
gutenberg.pglaf.org at two second intervals for that reason, and the mirror
serves byte-identical files. Check the equivalent policy before adding a source,
and never point automated fetches at an origin site that has asked you not to.

## Gotchas

- **Provisioning is not idempotent across a volume reset.** If a backend's
  volume is wiped but SoundStorm's state survives (or vice versa), you get a
  backend with an account whose password nobody holds. The provisioners detect
  this and say so rather than retrying forever. The fix is a human decision.
- **Reconnecting is not provisioning, and conflating them destroys credentials.**
  On restart SoundStorm beats the backends to listening. A failed health check then
  looks like "wrong password" unless you check what kind of failure it was, and
  re-provisioning an already-configured backend can never succeed - so one
  unlucky restart used to brick a backend with its working token still on disk.
  Only 401/403 means the credentials are wrong; 5xx, 429, dial errors and
  timeouts all mean wait. `transient()` in `internal/provision` owns that
  distinction and `provision_test.go` guards it. Jellyfin in particular accepts
  the connection while loading and answers 503.
- **Port 8099, not 8080.** A Calibre content server on this machine already
  holds 8080. `SOUNDSTORM_PORT` overrides.
- **Playback is negotiated, never assumed.** `StreamTarget` POSTs a device
  profile to Jellyfin's `/Items/{id}/PlaybackInfo` and does what it is told.
  Whether a file needs transcoding depends on container, video codec, audio
  codec, profile AND level; Jellyfin knows all five and we know none of them.
- **The device profile errs conservative on purpose.** Claiming a codec we
  cannot decode is the silent failure - Jellyfin hands over the original, the
  video element shows nothing, no error anywhere. Claiming too little only
  costs an unnecessary transcode. So: h264/aac in mp4, VPx/AV1 in webm, and
  everything else transcodes.
- **Transcoding is served as HLS, and the reason is seeking.** A progressive
  transcode has no length until it has finished encoding, so the browser
  reported `seekable.end` of 0, a 20s file showed a duration of 9.9s that grew
  as it buffered, and seeking to 15s snapped back to 3s. Jellyfin's HLS output
  is a VOD playlist listing every segment up front, which gives a real timeline:
  the same file now reports 20.0s, `seekable.end` 20.0, and seeking to 15s
  lands at 16.9s.
- **Jellyfin's playlists reference their children relatively** ("main.m3u8",
  "hls1/main/0.ts"), which is why `/api/hls/{source}/{path...}` mirrors
  Jellyfin's own `/videos/` namespace. Get that mapping right and the browser
  resolves every segment onto SoundStorm by itself; get it wrong and the only
  alternative is rewriting playlists.
- **Jellyfin's direct-play answer is not trusted on its own.** 12.1.0 reports
  `SupportsDirectPlay: true` for an MKV even when the device profile offers only
  mp4, so the container is checked a second time against the same list the
  profile advertises. Believing it reproduces the silent failure exactly.
- **Subtitle URLs are built, not taken from PlaybackInfo.** 12.1.0 leaves
  `DeliveryUrl` and `DeliveryMethod` empty even when the profile declares
  subtitle support, but `/Videos/{item}/{mediaSource}/Subtitles/{index}/Stream.vtt`
  works for embedded and sidecar tracks alike and converts SRT on the fly.
  Same pattern as HLS: read the info, construct the URL.
- **Only text subtitles are offered.** PGS, VOBSUB and DVB are pictures of
  text; attaching one as a track renders nothing at all, which is worse than
  offering nothing. Burning them in would need a re-encode.
- **No `crossorigin` on the video element.** Every media and subtitle URL is
  same-origin, so the cookie goes anyway; setting the attribute forces CORS
  semantics and the media then fails to load for want of headers nobody needs
  to send. Cost half an hour once.
- **hls.js is loaded lazily and may never load at all.** Recent Chrome plays
  HLS natively, so the fallback went unexercised on the first test run - forcing
  it (stub `canPlayType` to reject mpegurl) is the only way to know it works.
  Do that whenever the video path changes.
- **Transcodes must be stopped explicitly.** A Jellyfin transcode is an ffmpeg
  process that outlives the HTTP request, so `source.Target.OnDone` fires
  `DELETE /Videos/ActiveEncodings`. Verified that endpoint exists: it answers
  204, where a made-up path answers 404.
- **EPUB only.** The library scan ignores every other book format, and the
  reader only has foliate-js's EPUB modules vendored.
- **A Content-Security-Policy on the shell is load-bearing, not hardening.**
  EPUBs can contain scripts, and the reader renders book content in a blob:
  iframe that inherits SoundStorm's origin - without `script-src 'self'`, opening a
  book would run a stranger's JavaScript against the session cookie. `blob:` IS
  allowed in style-src and font-src, or books render unstyled.
- **An empty `libraries` list means nothing, and must never read back as nil.**
  `User.Libraries` has no `omitempty` for exactly this reason: with it, an
  account allowed no libraries would serialise to nothing, read back as nil,
  and silently mean *every* library. The one mistake this field cannot make is
  failing open, and there is a test that writes it, reads it back through the
  accounts list, and checks.
- **The state file has a schema version and a migration.** Version 1 had one
  `user`, sessions that were bare expiry timestamps, and bookmarks keyed by
  source and item alone; version 2 has accounts. The upgrade makes the existing
  account the owner, gives its sessions its id and its bookmarks its prefix, so
  nobody is signed out and nobody loses their place. `Session.UnmarshalJSON`
  accepts both shapes, which keeps the old one in a single place. Tested
  against a real v1 file, on disk, both in `internal/state` and on a running
  container.
- **Audiobook chapters are files, not chapter marks.** `TrackLister` reports an
  item's audio files and the dock plays through them, which covers a per-chapter
  rip - the shape of every LibriVox book. A single m4b with twenty chapter marks
  still returns one track: it plays through correctly but has no navigation,
  because seeking inside one file is a different problem from switching between
  several. Chapter *names* come from Audiobookshelf's chapter list when there is
  one per file, then the ID3 title tag, then the filename.
- **Listening position lives upstream, not in `internal/state`.** It is written
  to Audiobookshelf's own `PATCH /api/me/progress/{id}`, which is what makes a
  chapter finished in its mobile app the place a browser picks up. A private
  copy would quietly fork from the one every other client reads. Position is
  measured across the whole book, so `Track.StartSeconds` converts between "two
  hours in" and "a file and an offset".
- **Audiobookshelf does not derive `progress` from `currentTime`.** Send one
  without the other and the player resumes correctly while its own shelf and
  "continue listening" row keep showing the old percentage. The fraction is
  computed in the adapter for that reason. Verified on 2.36.1.
- **`isFinished` is one-way, and sending `false` is destructive.** For a book
  already marked finished it does not merely clear the flag - it resets
  `currentTime` and `progress` to zero, which is what "mark as unfinished"
  means in the Audiobookshelf UI. Someone who reached the end and scrubbed back
  would lose their place. So the flag is only ever sent as `true`; a later
  position clears it as a side effect anyway. Also note `progress: 1` alone is
  enough to mark a book finished.
- **Audiobookshelf stores a progress record without validating it.** PATCHing
  the string `"x"` as `currentTime` is accepted with a 200 and read straight
  back. So nothing leaves `handleSetPosition` that is not a time (a JSON number
  is never NaN, but `1e999` decodes to `+Inf` without complaint), and
  `mediaProgress` decodes leniently - strict decoding would turn one junk
  record into a permanent error for that book.
- **Some LibriVox MP3s ship mangled ID3 tags.** `fables_01_00_lafontaine` has
  double-encoded UTF-8 declared as latin-1, so its chapter reads
  "00 - ÃƒÂ€ Monseigneur le Dauphin". The damage is in the published file, not
  in Audiobookshelf and not in us; repairing it means guessing at a chain of
  mis-decodings that would corrupt any title legitimately containing those
  characters. Left alone deliberately.
- **PowerShell here-strings carry CRLF into `docker exec bash -c`**, and a
  trailing carriage return makes bash misread the command. `scripts/` passes
  single-line commands for that reason.
- **Library folders are created 0777 on purpose.** They exist to be written
  into by a person on the host whose uid SoundStorm cannot know, and read by four
  backends running as assorted other uids. Being unable to copy files into your
  own media folder is a far worse failure than a permissive mode on a home
  media directory. Revisit if SoundStorm ever grows PUID/PGID support.
- **The library skeleton is committed** (`library/*/README.txt`), so a fresh
  clone already has somewhere to put media; `.gitignore` keeps the structure and
  ignores the contents.
- **`scripts/mkepub` generates test books.** The sample-media script used to
  borrow Calibre's `ebook-convert` from the Calibre-Web container, which no
  longer exists. An EPUB is a zip with two XML files, so producing one needs
  neither Calibre nor a container.
- **The rename invalidated every provisioned volume.** The account SoundStorm
  creates on each backend is named after it, and the state file moved from
  /var/lib/atrium to /var/lib/soundstorm - so an install from before the rename
  finds backends already set up with credentials it does not hold, which is the
  one failure the provisioners cannot recover from on their own. The fix is
  `docker compose down -v` and a fresh provision. Worth remembering if the
  project is ever renamed again.
- **Navidrome's setting is `ND_SCANINTERVAL`, not `ND_SCANSCHEDULE`.** It
  ignores unknown keys silently, so the wrong name looks like it works while no
  periodic scan ever runs and new music appears only on restart. Verified
  against 0.64.0. Check `--help` in the container before trusting any of these
  env names.
- **Docker Desktop opens its dashboard on every start, and that has to be
  turned off before it first runs.** `OpenUIOnStartupDisabled` in
  `%APPDATA%\Docker\settings-store.json` does it - confirmed as a real key by
  finding the string inside Docker's own binary rather than by trusting a
  blog. Docker only stores settings that differ from its defaults, so on a
  fresh machine the key is absent and has to be added.

  It is written **before** the winget install as well as after, because Docker
  Desktop launches itself the moment its installer finishes - too early for
  anything the script does afterwards to prevent. Writing the file first is
  the only way the window never appears at all.

  Written without a byte order mark: `Set-Content -Encoding utf8` adds one in
  PowerShell 5.1, and a BOM in front of JSON is a good way to discover whether
  the reader is strict. Only ever called on the fresh-install path, so it sets
  a default rather than overriding somebody's choice.
- **Every external call in `install.ps1` must go through `Invoke-Native` or
  `Invoke-Docker`.** With `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'`, a bare native
  call throws on its first line of stderr. `Test-DockerRunning` was written as
  a bare `docker info` and therefore crashed in the one situation it exists to
  detect - Docker installed but not running, which is precisely the state
  immediately after installing Docker Desktop. It had been fixed once for
  `docker compose` and missed here, so the rule is now the helper, not
  vigilance.
- **Docker Desktop's installer needs administrator rights**, and a setup file
  run by double-clicking does not have them - so winget fails and the whole
  install stops on its first action with a bare exit code 1. `Install-Docker`
  asks for elevation with `Start-Process -Verb RunAs` for that one step rather
  than demanding the whole setup be run as administrator, which would put the
  library in whichever profile did the elevating.
- **Do not decode winget exit codes; look at whether docker is there.** The
  "already installed" code is `-1978335135` (0x8A150061), not the
  `-1978335189` that was hardcoded here for several commits, and there are
  more of them - a reboot-required result is a success that reads like a
  failure. Asking `Get-Command docker` afterwards is both simpler and right.
- **Smart App Control blocks any script downloaded from the web, by extension.**
  Double-clicking the downloaded `SoundStorm-Setup.cmd` gives "An Application
  Control policy has blocked this file. Dangerous file extension from the web",
  with no Run anyway. It has nothing to do with the contents - a two-line
  hello-world .cmd with mark-of-the-web is blocked identically - and it cannot
  be fixed in the file. Right-click, Properties, Unblock clears the mark and it
  then runs, which is why that is step one in the README.

  This hid behind a testing mistake worth remembering: `cmd /c script.cmd`
  does **not** go through the shell's reputation check, so every test passed.
  A double-click does. Reproduce it with `Start-Process`, which uses
  ShellExecute, not with `cmd /c`.

  The real fixes are a signed binary or a winget package; both are open.
- **Never pipe a downloaded script into PowerShell from the setup file.**
  `powershell -Command "iex ((New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(...))"`
  is the canonical malware download cradle, and Windows Defender blocks it on
  sight - "Access is denied", no explanation, on the very first thing a new
  user touches. It survived testing because `install.ps1` sat beside the .cmd
  in this checkout, so every run took the local branch and never fetched
  anything; the failure only appears when the file is downloaded on its own,
  which is exactly how everybody gets it. Fetch to a file with `curl.exe`
  (shipped with Windows since 10 build 1803) and run it with `-File`.
  Confirmed in `Get-MpThreatDetection`, and confirmed fixed by the same.
- **The Windows setup file is linked from a release, not from raw.** Clicking a
  `raw.githubusercontent` link opens the file in the browser rather than saving
  it: raw serves `text/plain` with no `Content-Disposition`, so a `.cmd` is
  displayed as text. A release asset serves `application/octet-stream` with
  `Content-Disposition: attachment`, which is an actual download. The stable
  link is `/releases/latest/download/SoundStorm-Setup.cmd`, so it follows the
  newest release without the README changing. Attach the file to every release.
- **The owner is `GabrielHollberg`, checked against `gh api user` rather than
  assumed.** It was `gabehollberg` for most of this project's life - guessed
  from an email address, and not a GitHub account at all (`gh api
  users/gabehollberg` answers 404). Every install URL in the README pointed at
  a dead end, and the Go import path named nobody. That is worth re-checking if
  it ever moves.
- **A GitHub username may have capitals; a container registry path may not.**
  `GabrielHollberg` is a fine account name and an invalid image reference, so
  the publish workflow folds `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER` to lowercase and the
  compose file names `ghcr.io/gabrielhollberg/soundstorm`. GitHub URLs keep
  their capitals; only registry references are folded.
- **Smart App Control blocks `go test` at random, and must not be turned off.**
  It refuses to exec freshly built, unsigned test binaries, so a run dies with
  "An Application Control policy has blocked this file" for a handful of
  packages that varies with every rebuild. Disabling it is **one-way**: Windows
  will not let it be re-enabled without a reset or reinstall, and it has no
  exclusion list. So work around it instead - run the suite in a container,
  which executes no Windows binary at all and is what CI does anyway:

  ```sh
  docker run --rm -v "//c/dev/atrium:/src" -w /src golang:1.24-alpine go test ./...
  ```

  The doubled slash is for MSYS, which otherwise rewrites `/src` into a Windows
  path. `go test -c -o` and then running the binary also usually works, but
  only usually - the container is the one that always does.
- **Dev on Windows, deploy to Linux** - but Windows is a deployment target
  too, and always has been: the whole stack runs on Docker Desktop, which is
  what `install.ps1` sets up. Go lives at `C:\dev\tools\go` (installed from
  the zip, on the user PATH). Docker Desktop must be running.
- **The binary itself runs natively on Windows**, verified: a `GOOS=windows`
  build produces a 37MB exe that serves, creates the library folders and
  scans ebooks with no Docker and no WSL. That is not the same as the product
  running natively - the other three media types are containers. Making those
  native would mean SoundStorm installing and supervising Jellyfin, Navidrome
  and Audiobookshelf as Windows processes, which is the "own the expensive
  part" trap this project exists to avoid, and Audiobookshelf has no official
  Windows build anyway.
- **No `go.sum`** and that is correct. Zero third-party dependencies, including
  password hashing — `crypto/pbkdf2` has been stdlib since Go 1.24.
- **Screenshots in `docs/shots/`** were captured with Playwright driving the
  system Chrome (`channel: 'chrome'`, no browser download). Note that Node on
  Windows does not resolve MSYS-style `/c/...` paths — pass `C:\...`.

## Commands

```sh
go test ./...
docker compose up --build
docker compose logs -f soundstorm          # watch provisioning
docker compose down -v                 # reset everything, including credentials
pwsh scripts/make-sample-media.ps1     # synthetic library, no downloads
```

`docker compose logs -f SoundStorm` is the fastest way to see why a backend is not
answering.
