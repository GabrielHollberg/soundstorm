# atrium — working notes for Claude

Read this first. It carries decisions that the code cannot tell you, including
two reversals of earlier decisions that looked right and were not.

## What this is

A unified front end for a self-hosted media library. One login, one search box,
one player over Navidrome and Jellyfin today; audiobooks and ebooks next.

The user's words for what they wanted: *"an all-encompassing server that can do
movies, audiobooks, ebooks, music all together... easy for users to install and
then create a login... and put their library into organized folders."*

## The decision that shapes everything

That request sounds like "build a media server". It is not, and the difference
is the whole project.

**Rejected: fork Jellyfin, or build a media server from scratch.** Either means
owning the expensive part — scanning disks, identifying media, storing metadata
and artwork, transcoding. That is years of work to arrive somewhere worse than
what exists. Forking additionally buys a permanent merge tax against a large
C# codebase, in exchange for the ability to change internals that none of the
requirements touch.

**Chosen: own the layer above.** Each backend owns exactly one media type and
one folder. Nothing scans the same folder twice. atrium owns login, search,
playback and the bytes. From the user's seat this is indistinguishable from a
single server — they never learn Jellyfin exists — but Jellyfin still does the
transcoding and Navidrome still does the music scanning.

Navidrome rather than Jellyfin for music specifically: multi-value artist tags,
album-artist vs artist, compilations, ReplayGain, smart playlists, fast scanner.
Jellyfin's music support is a second-class citizen next to its video support,
structurally. Getting Navidrome's music engine *for free* is exactly what the
fork would have made you rebuild by hand.

**If the seams leak, the whole thing is pointless.** Guard this. A result that
links out to a backend's web UI means a second login and a visibly different
app, and at that point you have built a bookmark folder.

## Two reversals from the first design

The original code was an API-only federating gateway. Its instincts were good
and two of them were wrong for this product:

1. **"Never proxy media bytes; results carry absolute upstream URLs."** An
   upstream URL only works if the browser can reach the upstream, which means
   publishing Jellyfin and Navidrome on their own ports, which means their login
   screens are one URL away. You cannot have "one login" and "never touch the
   bytes" at once. atrium is now in the data path. See `internal/stream`.
2. **"Stateless, restartable, no config writes."** Zero-keys provisioning means
   atrium generates credentials, so it must remember them. One login means a
   user and sessions. Both outlive a restart. See `internal/state` — note that
   it holds *only* credentials and the account, never anything about the media.

## What atrium deliberately does not do

Each of these has killed a project like this before.

- **Transcoding.** Jellyfin owns this.
- **Metadata scraping.** Each backend already owns its metadata.
- **Library scanning.** Same.
- **Client apps for TVs.** The graveyard.
- **Rebuilding an app store.** Installation is solved and crowded.

## Three rules the design rests on

1. **A dead backend must never take the search down.** Per-source deadline,
   per-source error slot, always 200, `degraded` says what is missing. Tests in
   `internal/federate` and `internal/httpapi` protect this.
2. **Normalization happens at the edge.** Only an adapter knows its backend's
   vocabulary. Everything past it speaks `media.Item`.
3. **A backend is two halves: search and provisioning.** A backend a human must
   configure by hand defeats the point. Both halves or it is not done.

## Verified against live servers

These were checked on a running stack, not inferred. Re-verify if versions move.

- **Jellyfin 12.1.0 rejects `X-Emby-Token` and `?api_key=` with 401.** The only
  form it accepts is `Authorization: MediaBrowser ... Token="..."`. Most docs
  and every older client still show the other two. This is why
  `source.Target` carries headers rather than just a URL.
- **Jellyfin's startup wizard is a plain REST API** (`/Startup/Configuration`,
  `/Startup/User`, `/Startup/RemoteAccess`, `/Startup/Complete`) and stops
  accepting calls once setup completes, which makes driving it safe.
- **Navidrome's first-run admin form POSTs to `/auth/createAdmin`** and that
  endpoint only works while no user exists. Same safety property.
- Both backends need a few seconds to a minute after container start, so
  provisioning retries with backoff in the background while atrium serves.

## Gotchas

- **Provisioning is not idempotent across a volume reset.** If a backend's
  volume is wiped but atrium's state survives (or vice versa), you get a
  backend with an account whose password nobody holds. Both provisioners detect
  this and say so rather than retrying forever. The fix is a human decision.
- **Port 8099, not 8080.** A Calibre content server on this machine already
  holds 8080. `ATRIUM_PORT` overrides.
- **`static=true` streaming only.** Anything a browser cannot natively decode
  (HEVC, DTS, MKV) will not play yet. Jellyfin's HLS endpoint with a device
  profile is the fix and it is the top of the roadmap.
- **Dev on Windows, deploy to Linux.** Go lives at `C:\dev\tools\go` (installed
  from the zip, on the user PATH). Docker Desktop must be running.
- **No `go.sum`** and that is correct. Zero third-party dependencies, including
  password hashing — `crypto/pbkdf2` has been stdlib since Go 1.24.
- **Screenshots in `docs/shots/`** were captured with Playwright driving the
  system Chrome (`channel: 'chrome'`, no browser download). Note that Node on
  Windows does not resolve MSYS-style `/c/...` paths — pass `C:\...`.

## Commands

```sh
go test ./...
docker compose up --build
docker compose logs -f atrium          # watch provisioning
docker compose down -v                 # reset everything, including credentials
pwsh scripts/make-sample-media.ps1     # synthetic library, no downloads
```

`docker compose logs -f atrium` is the fastest way to see why a backend is not
answering.
